# Anime Music Quiz
This will be an open source web application where users can test how well they know their anime themes.

## Current Features
These are the features that have been implemented:
* Basic CRUD functionality for adding/updating animes and themes

## Currently Working On
For the site, I am currently working on:
* AniList implementation to quickly add themes (skills: GraphQL, http requests)
* Styling the quiz page
* Brainstorming where to handle game logic (basic structure in JavaScript currently)

## Database 
As the site is still in its early phases, the database schema is very barebones and subject to change.
